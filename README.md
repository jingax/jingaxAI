## ‚úçÔ∏è Customizing the Chatbot (for Another Person)

To personalize JingaxAI for someone else:

1. Open the `about_me.txt` file.
2. Replace the content with the new individual's information, such as:
   - Full name
   - Education
   - Skills
   - Work experience
   - Projects
   - Hobbies, interests, and achievements

   Example:
   ```
   My name is John Doe. I graduated from MIT in Computer Science...
   ```

3. Save the file. The chatbot will automatically use the new content ‚Äî no other changes are necessary.

## üß† How It Works

JingaxAI reads the profile information from `about_me.txt`, embeds the text, and uses a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to answer user questions conversationally and accurately.
