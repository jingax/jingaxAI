Aastik holds a Master’s degree in Technology in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, graduating in 2023 with a CGPA of 9.5, and a Bachelor’s degree from JSS Noida, 2021. His academic foundation emphasizes machine learning (ML) in constrained setups, a focus reflected in his postgraduate thesis. Professionally, Aastik is a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Samsung Research, specializing in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). He has pioneered advancements in semantic search pipelines on edge devices, transitioning from tag-based search to natural language search using VLM pipelines to improve real-world queries like attribution, relation, order, and exclusion, enhancing search relevance for over 10 million flagship devices. He authored and submitted the NEXIN paper to EMNLP 2024 and filed a patent for exclusion-based image-text retrieval. Aastik led the development of Testsuite, a model evaluation tool used by over five teams, reducing evaluation time by 50%. The tool evaluates seven VLM pipelines on 60+ datasets, saving over 200 man-hours monthly. Aastik has published the following research papers: Framework for Co-distillation Driven Federated Learning to Address Class Imbalance in Healthcare, published in CODS-COMAD 2024, link : https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10383 . Machine Learning-Based Identification of Collusive Users in Twitter Stream, published in ComPE 2021, which won the Session’s Best Paper Award , link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9752090 . In addition to his professional achievements, Aastik contributed to projects such as:  LLM-based Multi-Agent Medical Assistant : Built an AI Medical Assistant with three LLM agents for edge devices, integrating smartwatch monitoring for vitals, medication reminders, and intelligent scheduling. Designed a privacy-first, modular architecture during the LLM Agents Hackathon at Berkeley RDI in 2024.  Multitask Federated Learning (August 2022 - June 2023): Led a joint team from IIT Bombay and MIT on federated learning in healthcare, publishing results in CODS-COMAD 2024. Experimented with class skew for five federated learning algorithms. Hostel Mess Review System (July 2021 - November 2021): Developed a Django-based mess review system with LDAP integration, complaint redressal, and campaign functionality for food quality improvement.  Intern-Web Development at IdealVillage (May 2020 - August 2020): Built features like a wallet system, subscription system, affiliate dashboard, and integrated payment APIs, significantly enhancing platform functionality. For his B.Tech thesis, Aastik led a project on identifying collusive users in Twitter streams (June 2020 - July 2021), developing a platform to detect black-market followers. The project achieved 87% accuracy, introduced two confidence indexes for account trustworthiness, and earned the Session’s Best Paper Award at ComPE 2021. Skills:Languages: Python, C/C++, Java, Rust, Kotlin. Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, ONNX, PyTorch Lightning, MLOps. Others: Django, Flask, LLM finetuning, AI agent modeling. He achieved all India rank 12 in GATE CSE 2021 exam. reach out to him on his mail aastik.solanki99@gmail.com, linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aastik-solanki/, see his github : https://github.com/jingax, see his portfolio: https://jingax.github.io/.
