Aastik holds a Master’s degree in Technology (M.Tech) in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, graduating in 2023 with an outstanding CGPA of 9.5, and a Bachelor’s degree (B.Tech) from JSS Noida, completed in 2021. His academic foundation emphasizes machine learning (ML) in constrained setups, a focus reflected in his postgraduate thesis. Professionally, Aastik is a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Samsung Research (August 2023 - Present), specializing in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). He has pioneered advancements in semantic search pipelines on edge devices, transitioning from tag-based search to natural language search using compressed VLM pipelines to improve real-world queries like attribution, relation, order, and exclusion, enhancing search relevance for over 10 million flagship devices. He introduced innovative model compression techniques, such as pruning and knowledge distillation, reducing model size by 16% and inference time by 25 ms per inference. He proposed new metrics like Recall@80p for image retrieval tasks and contributed to faster model training by 11% through a novel subset selection of negative pairs using submodular selection in SIGLIP for image-text alignment pretraining. Aastik is the main contributor to NEXIN (Negative Exclusion Inference) (January 2024 - Present), a novel preprocessing technique for exclusion search queries that improved result accuracy by over 85% for ΔU. He authored and submitted the NEXIN paper to EMNLP 2024 and filed a patent introducing new metrics and benchmarks for exclusion-based image-text retrieval. Aastik led the development of Testsuite (January 2024 - Present), a model evaluation tool used by over five teams, reducing evaluation time by 50%. The tool evaluates seven VLM pipelines on 60+ datasets, saving over 200 man-hours monthly. It delivers critical features like attention heatmaps and full project management, streamlining evaluation processes and providing comprehensive benchmarks. Aastik has published the following research papers: Framework for Co-distillation Driven Federated Learning to Address Class Imbalance in Healthcare, published in CODS-COMAD 2024, link : https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10383 .   Machine Learning-Based Identification of Collusive Users in Twitter Stream, published in ComPE 2021, which won the Session’s Best Paper Award , link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9752090 . In addition to his professional achievements, Aastik contributed to projects such as:  LLM-based Multi-Agent Medical Assistant (November 2024 - December 2024): Built an AI Medical Assistant with three LLM agents for edge devices, integrating smartwatch monitoring for vitals, medication reminders, and intelligent scheduling. Designed a privacy-first, modular architecture during the LLM Agents Hackathon at Berkeley RDI in 2024.  Multitask Federated Learning (August 2022 - June 2023): Led a joint team from IIT Bombay and MIT on federated learning in healthcare, publishing results in CODS-COMAD 2024. Experimented with class skew for five federated learning algorithms. Hostel Mess Review System (July 2021 - November 2021): Developed a Django-based mess review system with LDAP integration, complaint redressal, and campaign functionality for food quality improvement.  Intern-Web Development at IdealVillage (May 2020 - August 2020): Built features like a wallet system, subscription system, affiliate dashboard, and integrated payment APIs, significantly enhancing platform functionality. For his B.Tech thesis, Aastik led a project on identifying collusive users in Twitter streams (June 2020 - July 2021), developing a platform to detect black-market followers. The project achieved 87% accuracy, introduced two confidence indexes for account trustworthiness, and earned the Session’s Best Paper Award at ComPE 2021. Skills:Languages: Python, C/C++, Java, Rust, Kotlin. Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, ONNX, PyTorch Lightning, MLOps. Others: Django, Flask, LLM finetuning, AI agent modeling. Aastik’s accomplishments highlight his technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and ability to deliver innovative solutions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software development. He achieved all India rank 12 in GATE CSE 2021 exam.
