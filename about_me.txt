Aastik holds a Master’s degree in Technology (M.Tech) in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, graduating in 2023 with an outstanding CGPA of 9.5, and a Bachelor’s degree (B.Tech) from JSS Noida, completed in 2021. His academic foundation emphasizes machine learning (ML) in constrained setups, a focus reflected in his postgraduate thesis. Professionally, Aastik is an ML Engineer at Samsung Research, specializing in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). He has pioneered advancements in semantic search pipelines on edge devices, transforming tag-based search into semantic search using compressed VLM pipelines to improve real-world queries like attribution, relation, order, and exclusion. He introduced innovative model compression techniques, such as pruning and knowledge distillation, to ensure these models run efficiently on smartphones. Aastik proposed a novel metric, Barrier Potential, to evaluate the ordering of positive and negative images in NEXIN and released a benchmark for exclusion captions. Additionally, he experimented with submodular selection of negative pairs in SIGLIP for image-text alignment pretraining. His leadership in developing the Testsuite web tool, which provides in-depth analysis and evaluation of VLM pipelines, was instrumental in streamlining evaluation processes and creating comprehensive benchmarks for his team. Aastik’s work combines technical expertise in Python, Rust (beginner), model evaluation, and training paradigms with strong problem-solving skills and adaptability. His achievements underscore his ability to merge technical innovation with practical implementation, making significant contributions to cutting-edge projects in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
